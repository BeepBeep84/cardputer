# Cardputer Apps Collection (MicroHydra)

This repository is a collection of small interactive applications written for the [M5Stack Cardputer](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/cardputer) using **MicroHydra**, a framework based on MicroPython. Each app lives in its own folder and is tailored for Cardputer's unique interface and hardware.

## Apps Included

### [Boogotchi](https://randomboo.com/project/boogotchi/) (Virtual Pet)
A ghostly Tamagotchi-style game featuring "Boo", a spectral companion you care for by feeding, playing, and watching him bounce around the screen. Boo never dies—he's already dead.

### [Note Taking App](https://randomboo.com/project/m5-stack_cardputer/)
